## Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, images, audio, videos and synthetic data.

### What is ChatGPT? 
ChatGPT is a large language model that generates human-like text in response to a given text prompt. It is essentially a next word predictor. 

- ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI
- ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model, which is a type of transformer-based neural network architecture.
- The model is trained on a [large dataset of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) which contains entire internet, books, Wikipedia and more.

It can understand what we say or write, or rather, can generate knowledge from what they have learned from humans. It set to revolutionise the way we work.
It is showing sparks of cleverness that can accelerate automation.

### What are LLMs?

A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Large language models use transformer models and are trained using massive datasets â€” hence, large. This enables them to recognize, translate, predict, or generate text or other content.
