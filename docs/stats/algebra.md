### What is distiction between Gradient and Derivative?

A gradient is a vector that goes in the direction of a functionâ€™s sharpest ascend whereas a derivative quantifies the rate of shift of a function at a certain location.

- The derivative of a function is the change of the function for a given input.
- The gradient is simply a derivative vector for a multivariate function.
 - Although both ideas include calculating slopes, derivatives emphasize one variable while gradients take into account a few variables at once. [Source](https://allthedifferences.com/exploring-the-distinction-gradient-vs-derivative/)

### What is the Difference Between Gradient and Partial Derivative?

A gradient represents the vector pointing in the direction of the steepest ascent of an equation and encompasses partial derivatives about all variables, whereas a partial derivative reflects the rate of shift of a function about one particular variable while keeping other variables at a single value.
