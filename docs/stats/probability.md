# Proabability

## Proabability

probability in order to convey our predictive insights with certain degree of certainty.

Probability distributions are useful for risk management because they help you quantify and visualize the uncertainty and variability of your data, and how they affect your goals and decisions. For example, you can use a probability distribution to estimate the range of possible outcomes for a project, and the probability of achieving a certain target or deadline.

Once you have chosen a probability distribution that suits your data and situation, you can use it to calculate various measures of risk, such as the expected value, which represents the most likely or typical outcome, the variance and standard deviation, which indicate the level of uncertainty or volatility of your outcome, and percentiles and confidence intervals, which show the range of possible outcomes and the probability of achieving them

## Probability Distribution

**Probability** is the chance of event occurring success(1) or failure(0).

**Distribution** means how the ‚Äòpossible values‚Äô a variable can take and how they occur.

probability distribution represents the values of a variable that holds the probabilities of an experiment

distribution is useful when we need to know,
- which outcomes are most likely,
- the spread of potential values,
- and the likelihood of different results.

**probability mass function** is a function that gives the probability that a **discrete** random variable is exactly equal to some value. 

**probability density function** represents the density of a **continuous** random variable lying between a specific range of values.

Discrete Distributions :

Discrete distributions have finitely many outcomes, equal outcomes are called Equiprobability. Events with only two possible outcomes [True/False], so any event with two outcomes can be transformed into a Bernoulli Distribution.

This is a univariate probability distribution, which is the probability distribution of a single random variable. This is in contrast to a bivariate or multivariate probability distribution, which defines the probability distribution of two or more random variables.

|Problem Statement: A (blindfolded) marksman finds that on the average, he hits the target `4` times out of `5`. If he fires `4` shots, what is a probability of (a) more than `2` hits and (b) at least `3` misses?|||

|Uniform distribution |Normal distribution (Or) Gaussian distribution (Or) Bell Curve|Exponential distribution|
|---|---|---|
|uniform distribution specifies an equal probability across a given range of continuous values. In other words, it is a probability distribution with a constant probability.||Describes how long it takes for a continuous process to change state. The exponential distribution is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process.|
||Problem Statement: We have a dataset representing the weights of students in a school. Assume that the dataset is normally distributed with a mean of 60 kg and standard deviation 15 kg, represented by ùëÅ(60,15). What is the probability that a randomly selected person has a weight below 50 kgs?||
