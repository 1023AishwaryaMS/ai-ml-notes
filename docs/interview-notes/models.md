# ML Models - Interview Notes

### Briefly explain the K-Means clustering and how can we find the best value of K.

Refer to [Methods to Find the Best Value of K](docs/ml/ml-algorithms.md#methods-to-find-the-best-value-of-k)

### Explain the difference between KNN and k-means clustering.

- K-nearest neighbors represents a **unsupervised** **classification** algorithm used for classification.  It works by calculating the distance of 1 test observation from all the observation of the training dataset and then finding K nearest neighbors of it.
- k-means clustering is an **unsupervised** **clustering** algorithm that gathers and groups data into **k number of clusters**.

### For k-means or kNN, why do we use Euclidean distance over Manhattan distance?
