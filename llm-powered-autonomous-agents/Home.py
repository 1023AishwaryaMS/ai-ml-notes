[React prompt](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react) solve complex tasks using verbal reasoning.
ReAct is designed for tasks in which the LLM is allowed to perform actions for a task.

ReAct framework can allow LLMs to interact with external tools to retrieve additional information that leads to more reliable and factual responses.
        
[ReAct](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced_applications/react) is able to answer the question by,
- first reasoning about the question (**Thought 1**), 
- and then performing an action (**Act 1**) such as search internet. 
- it then receives an observation (**Obs 1**), 
- and continues with this thought, action, observation loop until it reaches a conclusion.
